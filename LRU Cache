The cache will be of a fixed size.
We need a queue of fixed size to find the least recently used page and a hashmap for lookup.
Case 1> The page you are looking up is not present in the map
        a) If the queue size is full, then delete the last element from queue and erase the element from hashmap too.
           Now, add the latest page to the front of the queue and make an entry in the hashmap
        b) Add the latest page to the front of the queue and make an entry in the hashmap
        
Case 2> If the page is present in the hashmap, Remove the element from the queue and add in the front of the list.
